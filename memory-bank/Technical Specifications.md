Hospitality Operations Platform Technical Specification
1. Executive Summary
The Hospitality Operations Platform is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and enhance hotel management by providing robust tools for guest profile management, concierge service orchestration, vendor relationship management, and intelligent operational data ingestion and discrepancy detection. The primary objective is to empower hotel staff with an intuitive, efficient, and secure system to manage daily operations, improve guest satisfaction, and ensure data accuracy.

Key technical decisions revolve around a modern, scalable, and maintainable stack. The frontend will leverage React for dynamic user interfaces and Tailwind CSS for rapid, utility-first styling, ensuring a highly responsive and visually consistent experience. The backend will be built with Node.js and TypeScript, providing a performant and type-safe environment for API development and business logic. PostgreSQL, managed through Supabase, will serve as the primary data store, offering robust relational capabilities, real-time features, and integrated authentication.

The high-level architecture is a client-server model, with the React frontend communicating with the Node.js backend via RESTful APIs. The backend interacts with the PostgreSQL database and integrates with external CRM/PMS systems for data ingestion. Supabase provides additional services such as authentication, storage, and real-time capabilities, reducing boilerplate and accelerating development.

Backend: Node.js, TypeScript, Express.js (or NestJS for larger scale), Zod, Prisma ORM (or TypeORM), Jest

Database: PostgreSQL (managed by Supabase)

Platform Services: Supabase (Authentication, Realtime, Storage, Edge Functions)

Deployment: Railway (Frontend & Backend), Supabase (Database)

2. System Architecture
2.1. Architecture Overview
The system will be developed as a monorepo, containing both the frontend and backend applications within a single Git repository. This approach facilitates code sharing, simplifies dependency management, and streamlines CI/CD processes. The backend will employ a microservices-oriented architecture, allowing for independent development, deployment, and scaling of core functionalities, while the frontend will remain a monolithic application for simplicity in the MVP.

2.2. System Components and their Relationships
Frontend Application (React): The user-facing web application, located within the monorepo (e.g., at packages/frontend), responsible for rendering the UI, handling user interactions, and communicating with the backend API.

Backend API Services (Node.js): A collection of RESTful API services, also located within the monorepo (e.g., at packages/backend). Each service will be responsible for a specific domain (e.g., Guest Management Service, Concierge Service, Vendor Service, Ingestion Service, Discrepancy Service). These services encapsulate business logic and interact with the database.

Shared Libraries/Packages: The monorepo will include shared code (e.g., DTOs, utility functions, types) that can be used by both frontend and backend, ensuring consistency and reducing duplication.

PostgreSQL Database (Supabase): The central data repository, storing all application data. Supabase provides managed PostgreSQL, authentication, and real-time capabilities.

Supabase Services:

Supabase Auth: Handles user authentication and authorization, integrating directly with PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS).

Supabase Storage: For storing unstructured data like profile pictures or attachments.

Supabase Realtime: Enables real-time updates for certain data, e.g., live status changes for concierge requests.

Supabase Edge Functions: For serverless functions that can be triggered by database events or HTTP requests, potentially used for lightweight background tasks or webhooks.

External APIs: Third-party systems such as CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and PMS (Property Management System) that provide operational data for ingestion.

2.4. Infrastructure Requirements
Hosting: Railway for both Frontend and Backend services. Railway provides a unified platform for deploying and managing applications.

Server Environment:

Node.js: The backend will run on the latest LTS version of Node.js.

Docker: All backend services will be containerized using Docker for consistency across development, staging, and production environments.

Networking: Railway handles networking, providing internal networking between services within a project and public endpoints for exposed services. This simplifies VPC, load balancer, and CDN management.

Monitoring & Logging: Centralized logging and monitoring solutions will be integrated (e.g., Railway's built-in logging, or external services compatible with Railway for advanced metrics and tracing) for application performance, errors, and security events.
