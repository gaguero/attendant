# Product Context: Attendandt

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
Hospitality businesses struggle with fragmented guest management systems that don't integrate well with vendor services and concierge operations. Current solutions often lack:
- Unified guest profile management
- Efficient vendor directory integration
- Streamlined concierge request workflows
- Automated data synchronization
- Real-time discrepancy detection

### Target Users
1. **Hotel Staff** - Front desk, concierge, and management personnel
2. **Concierge Services** - Staff managing guest requests and vendor coordination
3. **Administrators** - System administrators managing data ingestion and configurations
4. **Guests** - End users receiving services (indirect interaction)

## How It Should Work

### Core User Workflows

#### Guest Management Flow
1. Staff creates/updates guest profiles with comprehensive information
2. System validates data and provides immediate feedback
3. Guest information is available across all service touchpoints
4. Historical data is maintained for repeat guests

#### Vendor Directory Flow
1. Administrators manage vendor profiles and service categories
2. Staff can search and filter vendors by service type, location, rating
3. Vendor information is easily accessible during concierge requests
4. System tracks vendor performance and availability

#### Concierge Request Flow
1. Staff creates requests linking guests to specific services
2. Multi-step wizard guides through request creation
3. System suggests appropriate vendors based on request type
4. Request status is tracked through completion
5. Historical request data informs future recommendations

#### Data Ingestion Flow
1. Administrators configure data sources and ingestion rules
2. System automatically imports data from external sources
3. Discrepancy detection identifies data conflicts
4. Staff resolves discrepancies through guided interface
5. Clean data is integrated into the main system

## User Experience Goals

### Primary UX Principles
- **Clarity**: Every action should have clear, immediate feedback
- **Efficiency**: Common tasks should be completed quickly
- **Consistency**: UI patterns should be predictable across features
- **Accessibility**: Interface should be usable by all staff members
- **Reliability**: System should handle errors gracefully

### Specific UX Requirements
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders during data fetching
- **Error Handling**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation with helpful guidance
- **Navigation**: Intuitive sidebar navigation with clear hierarchy
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on desktop and tablet devices

### Screen States Implementation
- **Empty States**: Helpful guidance when no data exists
- **Loading States**: Clear indication of system activity
- **Error States**: Specific error messages with recovery options
- **Success States**: Confirmation of completed actions
