# Project Brief: Smart Hospitality Operations Platform

## 1. Project Summary

This project aims to develop a "Smart Hospitality Operations Platform" that integrates deeply with the Mews Property Management System (PMS). The platform will serve as a central hub for hotel staff to manage guest experiences, streamline operations, and drive ancillary revenue. It will provide real-time data synchronization with Mews, intelligent guest profile management, a sophisticated service orchestration system, and a powerful analytics dashboard.

The primary goal is to move beyond basic property management and create a proactive, data-driven operational tool. By enriching guest data, automating workflows, and providing actionable insights, the platform will empower staff to deliver personalized, high-quality service efficiently.

## 2. Key Objectives

*   **Deep Mews Integration**: Achieve seamless, bidirectional data synchronization with the Mews PMS for reservations, guest profiles, and billing.
*   **Intelligent Guest Profiles**: Create comprehensive, auto-enriched guest profiles with a "completeness score" to ensure staff have all necessary information before arrival.
*   **Streamlined Operations**: Build a real-time operations dashboard that provides at-a-glance views of arrivals, service requests, and operational health.
*   **Service Orchestration**: Develop a robust system for managing concierge services and vendor relationships, from request to fulfillment and billing.
*   **Data-Driven Insights**: Implement an analytics engine to track key performance indicators (KPIs), predict guest needs, and identify revenue opportunities.
*   **Mobile-First Design**: Ensure the platform is fully accessible and functional on mobile devices for on-the-go staff.

## 3. Scope of Work

The project is divided into seven phases:

1.  **Foundation & Core Integration**: Set up the monorepo, establish a connection with the Mews API, and build the core framework for real-time data exchange.
2.  **Smart Data Management**: Enhance the database schema for Mews integration and develop algorithms for guest profile scoring and data enrichment.
3.  **Real-time Operations Dashboard**: Design and build the primary user interface for staff, including dashboards for arrivals, service requests, and operational metrics.
4.  **Service Orchestration & Vendor Management**: Implement features for managing vendors, tracking service requests, and automating service-related workflows.
5.  **Advanced Analytics & AI Features**: Develop predictive analytics for guest satisfaction, revenue optimization, and demand forecasting. Build a custom reporting tool.
6.  **Integration Ecosystem & Mobile**: Extend the platform's capabilities with third-party integrations (e.g., WhatsApp, SMS) and develop a Progressive Web App (PWA).
7.  **Performance & Production Readiness**: Optimize the platform for performance, conduct thorough testing, and prepare for production deployment.

## 4. Target Audience

*   **Concierge Staff**: Primary users for managing guest requests and services.
*   **Front Desk Staff**: Users for managing guest check-ins and accessing guest profiles.
*   **Hotel Management**: Users for monitoring operational performance and accessing analytics.
*   **Vendors**: External users for receiving and updating service requests.

## 5. Success Metrics

*   **Technical**: >95% guest profile data completeness, <2s dashboard response time, 100% sync accuracy with Mews, >99.9% uptime.
*   **Business**: 50% reduction in manual data entry, 15% increase in ancillary revenue, improved guest satisfaction scores.
