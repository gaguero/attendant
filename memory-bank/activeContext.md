# Active Context

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-08

## Current Focus

**Phase 1: Foundation & Core Integration** has been completed successfully. All four sub-phases are now complete:

- ✅ **Phase 1.1: Project Foundation Setup** - Monorepo structure, dependencies, development environment
- ✅ **Phase 1.2: Mews API Integration Framework** - API client with authentication, rate limiting, error handling
- ✅ **Phase 1.3: Real-time WebSocket Connections** - WebSocket client with reconnection logic
- ✅ **Phase 1.4: Bidirectional Sync Engine** - Database schema updates, sync service framework

**Phase 2: Smart Data Management** has been completed successfully. Both sub-phases are now complete:

- ✅ **Phase 2.1: Enhanced Database Schema** - Sync tracking fields, audit logging, business rules engine
- ✅ **Phase 2.2: Smart Data Intelligence** - Completeness scoring, data gap detection, validation rules

## Completed Work

### Mews API Integration (Phase 1.2)
- Created `packages/backend/src/lib/mews.ts` with axios-based client
- Implemented authentication using Mews demo tokens from environment
- Added rate limiting (500 requests per 15 minutes) with in-memory tracking
- Implemented error handling with retries using `axios-retry` library
- Created initial DTOs in `packages/shared/src/dto/mews.dto.ts`

### WebSocket Integration (Phase 1.3)
- Created `packages/backend/src/lib/mews.ws.ts` with WebSocket client
- Connected to `wss://ws.mews-demo.com` with authentication
- Implemented event handlers for real-time updates
- Added automatic reconnection logic (5-second intervals)
- Integrated WebSocket client into server startup process

### Database & Sync Framework (Phase 1.4)
- Updated Prisma schema with `mewsId` and `syncedAt` fields for User, Guest, Vendor models
- Successfully applied database migration via Supabase SQL execution
- Created `packages/backend/src/services/sync.service.ts` for event orchestration
- Integrated sync service with WebSocket event handling
- Regenerated Prisma client with new fields

## Current Status

The foundation is now complete and ready for testing. The system can:
- Connect to Mews API with proper authentication and rate limiting
- Establish WebSocket connections for real-time events
- Handle database operations with sync tracking fields
- Process incoming Mews events (currently logging only)

## Next Steps

The next phase is **Phase 3: Real-time Operations Dashboard**, which includes:
- Smart Dashboard System with real-time metrics
- Arrival Readiness Board with completeness scores
- Service Opportunity Tracker for upselling
- Staff Task Management with priority system
- Advanced Notification System with multi-channel alerts

## Testing Opportunities

Current implementation can be tested for:
- Mews API connectivity and rate limiting
- WebSocket connection stability and reconnection
- Database operations with new sync fields
- Event handling and logging
- **NEW**: Profile completeness scoring accuracy
- **NEW**: Business rules validation engine
- **NEW**: Data gap detection and recommendations
- **NEW**: Enhanced sync service with validation
- **NEW**: API endpoints for data intelligence features

## Technical Decisions Made

- **HTTP Client**: Used `axios` for Mews API client due to built-in interceptors and better error handling
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented simple in-memory counter (can be upgraded to Redis later)
- **WebSocket**: Used `ws` library for Node.js WebSocket client
- **Database Migration**: Applied via Supabase SQL execution due to Prisma CLI connection issues
- **Sync Strategy**: "Last-write-wins" with timestamp-based conflict resolution
- **Completeness Scoring**: Weighted algorithm with configurable field importance
- **Business Rules**: Configurable validation engine with priority-based execution
- **Data Intelligence**: Service-oriented architecture for modular data processing
