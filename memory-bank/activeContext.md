# Active Context

## Current Focus
**Phase 3: Real-time Operations Dashboard** - ðŸš€ **IN PROGRESS**

## Recent Changes
Successfully completed Phase 3.1: Dashboard Foundation and pushed to GitHub.

### âœ… Phase 2: Smart Data Management - COMPLETED
- Enhanced database schema with sync tracking and intelligence fields
- Data completeness scoring service (0-100%)
- Configurable business rules engine
- Enhanced sync service with validation and audit logging
- RESTful API endpoints for data intelligence
- Initialization system for automated setup

### âœ… Phase 3.1: Dashboard Foundation - COMPLETED
- **Dashboard Service**: Real-time data aggregation and metrics calculation
- **Dashboard API Routes**: RESTful endpoints for dashboard data, metrics, alerts, and sync status
- **Dashboard Page**: Main dashboard component with real-time updates (30-second intervals)
- **Dashboard Components**:
  - `DashboardMetrics`: Key metrics cards with color-coded indicators
  - `SyncStatus`: Real-time sync connection monitoring with heartbeat tracking
  - `AlertsPanel`: Alert management with priority levels and read/unread status
  - `RealTimeStats`: Entity overview and system health statistics
  - `DataQualityOverview`: Data quality scoring with visual progress indicators

## Next Steps
**Phase 3.2: Data Intelligence UI**

### Phase 3.2: Data Intelligence UI
- Build completeness score visualization with detailed breakdowns
- Create data gap analysis interface with actionable recommendations
- Implement business rules management UI with rule creation/editing
- Add sync operation monitoring dashboard with detailed logs
- Create data quality trend analysis with historical charts

### Phase 3.3: Analytics and Reporting
- Create data quality trend analysis over time
- Implement sync performance metrics and optimization insights
- Add user activity tracking and engagement analytics
- Build comprehensive reporting system with export capabilities

## Testing Opportunities
### Phase 3.1 Testing
- **Dashboard Service**: Test real-time data aggregation and metrics calculation
- **API Endpoints**: Verify dashboard endpoints return correct data structure
- **Frontend Components**: Test dashboard components with various data states
- **Real-time Updates**: Verify 30-second refresh intervals work correctly
- **Alert System**: Test alert creation, reading, and priority handling

### Phase 2 Testing
- **Completeness Scoring**: Test accuracy of 0-100% scoring algorithm
- **Business Rules**: Validate rule creation, updates, and enforcement
- **Enhanced Sync**: Test sync with validation and completeness tracking
- **API Endpoints**: Verify all completeness and business rules endpoints
- **Initialization**: Test Phase 2 setup script with existing data

### Database Migration
- Apply Phase 2 schema changes via Supabase SQL execution
- Run initialization script to set up default configurations
- Verify data integrity after migration

## Active Decisions
- **Dashboard Architecture**: Service-oriented with real-time data aggregation
- **Update Frequency**: 30-second intervals for real-time dashboard updates
- **Alert System**: Priority-based with read/unread status tracking
- **Data Visualization**: Color-coded metrics with progress indicators
- **Component Design**: Modular, reusable dashboard components

## Current Challenges
- **Database Connection**: Prisma CLI has connection issues, using Supabase for migrations
- **Data Migration**: Need to apply schema changes and initialize Phase 2 features
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing needed for new dashboard features
- **Real-time Performance**: Optimize dashboard data aggregation for large datasets

## Key Metrics
- **Dashboard Performance**: Real-time data loading and update speeds
- **User Engagement**: Dashboard usage and interaction patterns
- **Alert Effectiveness**: Alert response times and resolution rates
- **Data Quality**: Real-time quality score tracking and improvement trends
