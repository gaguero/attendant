# Active Context

## Current Focus
**Phase 3: Real-time Operations Dashboard** - ðŸš€ **IN PROGRESS**

## Recent Changes
Successfully completed Phase 2 implementation and pushed to GitHub. Now beginning Phase 3 development.

### âœ… Phase 2: Smart Data Management - COMPLETED
- Enhanced database schema with sync tracking and intelligence fields
- Data completeness scoring service (0-100%)
- Configurable business rules engine
- Enhanced sync service with validation and audit logging
- RESTful API endpoints for data intelligence
- Initialization system for automated setup

## Next Steps
**Phase 3: Real-time Operations Dashboard**

### Phase 3.1: Dashboard Foundation
- Create real-time dashboard with WebSocket connections
- Implement live data visualization components
- Add real-time sync status monitoring
- Create alert system for sync failures and data quality issues

### Phase 3.2: Data Intelligence UI
- Build completeness score visualization
- Create data gap analysis interface
- Implement business rules management UI
- Add sync operation monitoring dashboard

### Phase 3.3: Analytics and Reporting
- Create data quality trend analysis
- Implement sync performance metrics
- Add user activity tracking
- Build comprehensive reporting system

## Testing Opportunities
### Phase 2 Testing
- **Completeness Scoring**: Test accuracy of 0-100% scoring algorithm
- **Business Rules**: Validate rule creation, updates, and enforcement
- **Enhanced Sync**: Test sync with validation and completeness tracking
- **API Endpoints**: Verify all completeness and business rules endpoints
- **Initialization**: Test Phase 2 setup script with existing data

### Database Migration
- Apply Phase 2 schema changes via Supabase SQL execution
- Run initialization script to set up default configurations
- Verify data integrity after migration

## Active Decisions
- **Schema Migration Strategy**: Using manual SQL migration via Supabase due to Prisma CLI connection issues
- **Completeness Algorithm**: Using weighted scoring based on field importance and completion status
- **Business Rules Priority**: Implementing priority-based rule execution order
- **Sync Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for all sync operations
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with consistent response formats

## Current Challenges
- **Database Connection**: Prisma CLI has connection issues, using Supabase for migrations
- **Data Migration**: Need to apply schema changes and initialize Phase 2 features
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing needed for new data intelligence features

## Key Metrics
- **Completeness Scores**: Tracking 0-100% profile completion across all entities
- **Sync Success Rate**: Monitoring successful vs failed sync operations
- **Data Quality**: Measuring improvement in data completeness over time
- **Rule Effectiveness**: Tracking validation rule performance and impact
