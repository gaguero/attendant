# Active Context: Attendandt Project

## Current Focus

The "Forgot Password" email functionality and the initial sidebar/navigation refactor are complete. The immediate focus is **UI design refinement** for the already-implemented features (Authentication, Profile, Guests, Vendors).

## Next Steps

• Complete UI polish for:
  – Authentication forms (Step 6)  
  – Profile page & Avatar upload (Step 8)  
  – Guest management views (Step 10)  
  – Vendor directory & forms (Step 11)
• Ensure full responsiveness, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), and consistent Tailwind styling.  
• Add toast notifications and interactive feedback across CRUD operations.

## Recent Accomplishments (Step 4.1)

1.  **Forgot Password Email Service**:
    -   **Nodemailer Integration**: Successfully integrated Nodemailer for sending emails via SMTP. The mailer is configured in `packages/backend/src/lib/mailer.ts` and uses credentials from the environment file.
    -   **Email Sending Logic**: The `/auth/forgot-password` route now calls the mailer service to send a password reset link to the user's email address.
    -   **Security**: The endpoint prevents user enumeration by sending a generic success response regardless of whether the email exists in the database.
    -   **Configuration**: SMTP settings are managed centrally in `packages/backend/src/config/index.ts` with Zod validation.

## Recent Accomplishments (Step 11)
- **Vendor Management System**: Completed the full implementation, including database schema, backend routes, frontend UI, and tests.

## Previous Accomplishments (Step 5)
1. **User Management API** (`packages/backend/src/routes/users.ts`):
   - `GET /api/v1/users` - List users with pagination and filtering (ADMIN/MANAGER only)
   - `GET /api/v1/users/:id` - Get specific user (own profile or ADMIN/MANAGER)
   - `POST /api/v1/users` - Create new user (ADMIN only)
   - `PUT /api/v1/users/:id` - Update user profile (own profile or ADMIN)
   - `DELETE /api/v1/users/:id` - Delete user (ADMIN only, cannot delete self)
   - `POST /api/v1/users/:id/reset-password` - Admin password reset

2. **Role-Based Access Control**: Comprehensive RBAC implementation
   - Users can only access/modify their own profiles
   - ADMIN can access/modify any user
   - MANAGER can view all users but limited modify access
   - Self-protection: Admins cannot delete their own accounts

3. **Data Validation and Security**: Robust validation throughout
   - Zod schema validation for all inputs
   - Email uniqueness checking across operations
   - Password security with bcrypt hashing
   - Comprehensive error handling and logging

4. **Pagination and Search**: Advanced querying capabilities
   - Pagination with page/limit controls
   - Search across email, firstName, lastName
   - Role-based filtering
   - Proper pagination metadata (totalPages, hasNext, etc.)

5. **Express Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into app
   - Mounted at `/api/v1/users` endpoint
   - Authentication middleware properly applied
   - Consistent response format with other endpoints

## Previous Accomplishments (Step 4)
1. **JWT Authentication System** (`packages/backend/src/lib/auth.ts`):
   - Token generation (access & refresh) with 15-minute/7-day expiration
   - Token verification and validation with proper error handling
   - Token blacklisting system for secure logout
   - Auth response generation with user data and tokens
   - Secure password hashing with bcrypt (12 salt rounds)

2. **Authentication Middleware** (`packages/backend/src/middleware/auth.ts`):
   - `requireAuth` - Protects routes requiring authentication
   - `optionalAuth` - Adds user context when token present
   - `requireRole` - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Pre-built role middlewares (Admin, Staff, Manager)
   - Extended Express Request type with user context

3. **Authentication Routes** (`packages/backend/src/routes/auth.ts`):
   - `POST /api/v1/auth/register` - User registration with validation
   - `POST /api/v1/auth/login` - User login with credentials
   - `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` - Token refresh for session extension
   - `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` - Secure logout with token blacklisting
   - `POST /api/v1/auth/change-password` - Password change for authenticated users
   - `GET /api/v1/auth/profile` - Current user profile retrieval

4. **Authentication DTOs** (`packages/shared/src/dto/auth.dto.ts`):
   - `LoginDto` - Email/password validation
   - `RegisterDto` - User registration with password confirmation
   - `RefreshTokenDto` - Token refresh validation
   - `ChangePasswordDto` - Password change validation
   - `JwtPayloadDto` - Token payload structure
   - `AuthResponseDto` - Authentication response format

5. **Environment Configuration Updated**:
   - Updated `env.example` with correct Supabase credentials
   - Added JWT_SECRET configuration for token signing
   - Ready for local development after file rename

## Technical Validation

## Next Steps (Step 5 Preparation)
1. **User Management API**:
   - Create user CRUD operations (GET, PUT, DELETE)
   - Implement user profile management endpoints
   - Add user search and filtering capabilities

2. **User Administration Routes**:
   - GET /api/v1/users - List users with pagination
   - GET /api/v1/users/:id - Get specific user
   - PUT /api/v1/users/:id - Update user profile
   - DELETE /api/v1/users/:id - Soft delete user
   - POST /api/v1/users/:id/reset-password - Admin password reset

3. **Enhanced User Operations**:
   - User profile photo upload
   - User activity logging
   - User role management (admin operations)

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Security Strategy**: JWT with short-lived access tokens (15min) and longer refresh tokens (7d)
2. **Password Security**: bcrypt with 12 salt rounds for strong hashing
3. **Authorization**: Role-based access control with middleware functions
4. **Token Management**: In-memory blacklist for development (Redis in production)
5. **API Structure**: RESTful endpoints with consistent validation
