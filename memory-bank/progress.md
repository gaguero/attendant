# Project Progress

This document tracks the high-level progress of the Smart Hospitality Operations Platform, reflecting the phases outlined in `TASKS.md`.

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-01

## Current Status

**Phase 1: Foundation & Core Integration** has been completed successfully. The platform now has a solid foundation with Mews API integration, real-time WebSocket connections, and database schema ready for bidirectional synchronization.

**Phase 2: Smart Data Management** has been completed successfully. The platform now includes intelligent data management capabilities with profile completeness scoring, data gap detection, configurable business rules, and enhanced synchronization with audit logging.

**Phase 3: Real-time Operations Dashboard** has been completed successfully! The dashboard is now fully functional with real-time metrics, graceful degradation, and all components rendering properly.

## Phase-by-Phase Progress

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Integration
**Status**: ✅ Completed

*   **[✅] Phase 1.1: Project Foundation Setup**: Completed. The monorepo is functional, dependencies are installed, and the development servers are running correctly. The database connection is verified, and environment file templates are in place.
*   **[✅] Phase 1.2: Mews API Integration Framework**: Completed. Created axios-based API client with authentication, rate limiting (500 requests per 15 minutes), error handling with retries, and initial DTOs.
*   **[✅] Phase 1.3: Real-time WebSocket Connections**: Completed. Implemented WebSocket client connecting to `wss://ws.mews-demo.com` with authentication, event handlers, and automatic reconnection logic.
*   **[✅] Phase 1.4: Bidirectional Sync Engine**: Completed. Updated database schema with `mewsId` and `syncedAt` fields, created sync service framework, and integrated with WebSocket events.

### Phase 2: Smart Data Management
**Status**: ✅ Completed

*   **[✅] Phase 2.1: Profile Completeness System**: Completed. Implemented intelligent scoring with configurable field weights and gap detection.
*   **[✅] Phase 2.2: Business Rules Engine**: Completed. Created configurable validation system with multiple rule types and smart recommendations.
*   **[✅] Phase 2.3: Enhanced Sync Service**: Completed. Built sync service with validation, audit logging, and error handling.
*   **[✅] Phase 2.4: Data Intelligence API**: Completed. Created API endpoints for managing completeness scoring and business rules.

### Phase 3: Real-time Operations Dashboard
**Status**: ✅ Completed

*   **[✅] Phase 3.1: Dashboard Foundation**: Completed. Built responsive dashboard with real-time metrics and component structure.
*   **[✅] Phase 3.2: Metrics & Analytics**: Completed. Implemented comprehensive metrics including user/guest/vendor counts, completeness scores, and sync status.
*   **[✅] Phase 3.3: Real-time Updates**: Completed. Added 30-second refresh intervals and real-time data display.
*   **[✅] Phase 3.4: Error Handling**: Completed. Implemented graceful degradation for missing database columns and API failures.
